Computer Science Student
------------------------

Hello! I am a computer science student thriving in the vibrant city of Athens. I am engrossed in data manipulation and trying to uncover some hidden truths within numbers. However, it goes far beyond lecture rooms and algorithms for me. Life is an unfolding classroom and I am here just for it. Eager to unravel the intricacies of data but maybe more importantly, a perennial life learner At least every new lesson regardless of how small or big it could be does slowly mold me into a better me. The beauty of knowledge lies in its endlessness. Not only do I open my mind to learning, but I also embrace it completely. The more information you have, the greater contribution you can make, hence an unending cycle that drives my personal and professional growth forward.

*   üåç  I'm based in Athens, Greece
