Computer Science Student
------------------------

Hey there!
I‚Äôm a Computer Science student living in the vibrant city of Athens. Most of the time, I‚Äôm exploring datasets, refining code for group projects, and spotting patterns that might go unnoticed at first glance. Through my coursework, I‚Äôve learned a lot about turning raw data into insights that help solve real-world problems. 
Whether chasing down a persistent bug or organizing my schedule to stay on top of academic obligations, I rely on solid planning, clear communication with my peers, and a healthy dose of curiosity to keep pushing forward. I also love picking up new skills‚Äîevery time I discover a new tool or perspective, it makes me better equipped to tackle the challenges ahead. 
I believe a willingness to learn and adapt is key to truly making a difference in a field that never stops evolving.

*   üåç  I'm based in Athens, Greece
